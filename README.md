# is-there-a-mismatch

Artifact repository for the FSE2017 accepted paper "Is There a Mismatch Between Real-World Feature Models and Product-Line Research?".
Authors: Alexander Knüppel, Thomas Thüm, Stephan Mennicke, Jens Meinicke, Ina Schafer

Included are various tools for the analysis of real-world feature models with respect to their cross-tree constraints.
See index.html for further details.

Many many thanks to Thorsten Berger for the FeatureIDE exporter.

TODO: add a more sophisticated guide (and possible tool chain) for the translation from KConfig and CDL to the FeatureIDE file format.
